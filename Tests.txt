Names: Jordan Tehranchi and Tommy Bullock

- We setup all the tests with a @BeforeAll to create an instance of the board using the Singleton Pattern
- Our board takes a parametrized constructor in which we initialized to 50x50 for the assignment purpose,
however, will change once we setup the methods within the Class stubs in a future assignment.

- First we test to see if the Room Labels from our board match their respective names to ensure proper data loading

- Another test confirms the dimension with Constants we have set for the COL and ROW lengths

- In testing the door directions:
1.) The Swimming Pool has a door opening to the LEFT
2.) The Lounge has a door opening UP
3.) The Auditorium has a door opening DOWN
4.) The Observatory has a door opening RIGHT
5.) Also tests that a walkway is not a door

- Another test checks for the Number of Doorways compared to a set Constant.

- Finally, four more tests check for secret passage cells, unused cells, walkways, and room centers/labels.
